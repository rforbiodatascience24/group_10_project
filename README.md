## How to Access The Data

The data can be found on kaggle.com with the name of the data set being;
Drug Dataset: Uses, Side Effects and User Review.

The data set can be found directly here:
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadyasingh55/drug-dataset>

### Download of Data

Our code is built to download the raw data directly from the URL
(<https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/aadyasingh55/drug-dataset>),
if not present on your local server already. The required folders will
automatically be created when using our code as well.

It is also possible to download the data by yourself, and upload it
directly to the server, or equivalent to where you have chosen to work.
If done so, you should first create a folder called 'data' which should
then contain a folder called \_raw.
