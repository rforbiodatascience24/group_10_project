#### Making count variables for 'Side_Effects'

```{r}
aug_clean_data <- clean_data |>
  
  # Counting for each row, as nr. of side effects might differ
  rowwise() |>
  
  # mutating in order to make SE_count variable with sum of Column containing SE in         header as this refer to side       effects listed for each row 
  mutate(Side_Effects_count = sum(!is.na(c_across(contains("Side_Effects_")))))
  
```

#### Making count variable for 'name_API'

```{r}
aug_clean_data <- clean_data |>
  
  # Counting for each row, as nr. of side effects might differ
  rowwise() |>
  
  # mutating in order to make SE_count variable with sum of Column containing SE in         header as this refer to side       effects listed for each row 
  mutate(API_count = sum(!is.na(c_across(contains("name_API_")))))
```
