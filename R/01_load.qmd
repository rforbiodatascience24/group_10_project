## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```

```{r}
# Define directories
raw_dir <- "/net/pupil1/home/people/s203566/Exercises/group_10_project/_raw/"
save_dir <- "/net/pupil1/home/people/s203566/Exercises/group_10_project/data/"

# Read the Excel file
Read_raw_data <- read_excel(path = str_c(raw_dir, "raw_data.xlsx"))

# Write the data to a TSV file
write_tsv(x = read_raw_data, file = str_c(save_dir, "01_dat_load.tsv"))

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
